# README

todo list: 
1. Progress view. Tell me how many words in total I've learned, how many I've mastered, how many I'm so-so on. 
1. Download my flash cards as a CSV.
1. Mobile support. 
1. Duplicate detection. If word already exists, prompt the user that a similar word already exists and ask if they want to skip adding this word. 
2. Add more interesting ways to decide which cards to show, based on mastery. Basically implement spaced repition properly. 
3. Better UI design
4. Put it online somewhere and maybe add a login system. 
5. "proper" spaced reptition. 
6. Allow adding audio clips to flash cards. 
7. Allow adding non-latin text to flash cards and having that be another axis of review maybe.
